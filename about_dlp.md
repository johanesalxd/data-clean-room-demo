# Data Protection Strategy for BigQuery Data Clean Rooms

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the key findings from our analysis of Google Cloud's data protection capabilities for BigQuery data clean rooms. The core recommendation is to use a **layered, integrated approach** that combines multiple technologies rather than choosing a single solution.

The optimal strategy follows the **"Discover, Classify, Protect, and Analyze" (DCPA) lifecycle**:

1. **Discover:** Use Sensitive Data Protection (DLP) to automatically find sensitive data
2. **Classify:** Use DLP's extensive library to categorize data types (PII, PHI, financial data)
3. **Protect:** Use BigQuery's Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) for real-time access control
4. **Analyze:** Enable secure analytics through masked data and differential privacy

## Key Technologies Overview

### BigQuery Dynamic Data Masking (DDM)
- **Purpose:** Real-time, query-level access control
- **How it works:** Applies masking rules at query time based on user identity
- **Best for:** Operational analytics, BI dashboards, developer access
- **Key advantage:** No performance impact, single source of truth
- **Cost:** Bundled with BigQuery Enterprise/Enterprise Plus editions

### BigQuery Differential Privacy
- **Purpose:** Anonymizing aggregate results for statistical analysis
- **How it works:** Adds calibrated statistical noise to aggregate queries
- **Best for:** External data sharing, research, public statistics
- **Key advantage:** Mathematical privacy guarantees
- **Limitation:** Slower query execution, requires careful configuration

### Sensitive Data Protection (DLP)
- **Purpose:** Discovery, classification, and transformation of sensitive data
- **How it works:** Scans data at rest, identifies 150+ types of sensitive information
- **Best for:** Data discovery, compliance audits, automated governance
- **Key advantage:** Comprehensive scanning and structured metadata output
- **Cost:** Pay-per-byte processed (can be expensive for large datasets)

## The Secure Join Problem in Data Clean Rooms

### The Challenge
When sharing data between organizations (merchant and e-wallet provider), you cannot join on raw PII like email addresses because:
1. It exposes sensitive information to the other party
2. It violates privacy principles of data clean rooms
3. It creates compliance and security risks

### The Solution: One-Way Deterministic Hashing

Based on the analysis, the **best practice for data clean rooms** is **one-way, key-based hashing**:

#### Why This Works
- **Deterministic:** Same input always produces same output (enables joins)
- **Irreversible:** Cannot be decrypted to reveal original PII
- **Secure:** Uses cryptographic hashing with a secret salt
- **Simple:** Can be implemented directly in BigQuery SQL

#### Implementation Method
```sql
-- Both parties apply the same transformation
TO_BASE64(SHA256(CONCAT(email, 'SHARED_SECRET_SALT'))) AS hashed_email
```

#### Alternative: Cloud KMS-Based Encryption
For enterprise scenarios, you can use:
- `DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT` with Cloud KMS keys
- More secure but more complex setup
- Requires careful IAM permission management

## Recommended Architecture for This Demo

### For the Data Clean Room Demo
1. **Use One-Way Hashing:** Implement SHA256 with shared salt for email join keys
2. **Remove Raw PII:** Exclude original email columns from shared views
3. **Enable Joins:** Both merchant and provider hash emails identically
4. **Preserve Analytics:** Hashed emails work perfectly for joins and ML models

### Why This is Best Practice
- **Security:** Other party cannot reverse-engineer email addresses
- **Functionality:** Joins work perfectly on hashed values
- **Simplicity:** No complex key management required
- **Realistic:** Mirrors real-world data clean room implementations

## Key Takeaways

1. **It's Not "Either/Or":** Use DLP for discovery + BigQuery DDM for enforcement
2. **Security First:** Never join on raw PII in data clean rooms
3. **Deterministic Hashing:** Enables secure joins while protecting privacy
4. **Layered Approach:** Combine multiple technologies for comprehensive protection
5. **Automation:** Use DLP findings to automatically configure DDM policies

This approach transforms your demo from a simple data sharing example into a sophisticated, security-conscious data clean room that follows industry best practices.
